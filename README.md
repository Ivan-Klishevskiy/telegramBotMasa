This a small Telegram-bot for Masa that lets you leave messages for the madrih and also has a voting feature for the next meeting topic.

Since Heroku no longer provides free hosting, im using hosting service called replit.com for this project.
It lets you host projects for free, but if there are no requests to the project for more than 10 minutes, it gets disconnected.
To avoid that, im using a website called uptimeRobot.com. It sends requests to the specified URL at regular intervals.

To get the app up and running, all you need to do is provide your Telegram bot token.
